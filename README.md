# Title: Analysis of Textual Features in the Domain of Sentiment and Their Impact on Financial Markets Using Natural Language Processing Methods

# Abstract:
This thesis explores the evolving landscape of financial market prediction through the integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and advanced machine learning models. By analyzing sentiment extracted from tweets, the research aims to forecast market trends more accurately. Negative and positive sentiments in social media posts have been found to significantly influence market movements. The study employs LSTM neural networks and autoencoders to extract complex textual features and improve prediction accuracy. Results demonstrate that combining sentiment analysis with deep learning models leads to more effective market predictions, marking a step forward in the application of machine learning in finance.
